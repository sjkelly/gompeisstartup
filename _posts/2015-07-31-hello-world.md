This website exists to provide resources for the entrepreneur community in
Worcester. As the colloquial "heart of the commonwealth", Worcester was central
in the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Today it is a growing center
of higher education and medical development.

It is an affordable area with a diverse talent pool. Last year I took a hiatus
from WPI to join Voxel8 and later participate in the Owlspark Accelerator.
I am just beginning to understand market validation and business development,
and there is still much to learn. I have been exposed to the resources available
to startups in Houston and Boston, and hope we can build similar foundations
in Worcester. Over the next few months I will be forming a company to
commercialize some of my work. As I find more information and resources I will
share them here.

I hope this website will help others succeed in their business development
or encourage the community to fill in the gaps. It is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sjkelly/startupthewoo) so there can be an open
dialogue and collaboration with the community.
